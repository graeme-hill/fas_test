Auto-discovers test classes in the working directory and runs the tests with
basically no boot up time and no configuration.  It doesn't matter how you
structure your project, instead, simple naming conventions are used:

 - All test files should be named *_tests.rb
 - All test methods should be named test__*

Other things you need to know:

 - All test classes should inherit FasTest::TestClass
 - There are two setup and two teardown methods:
   - class_setup: Called once before any of the tests
   - class_teardown: Called once after any of the tests
   - test_setup: Called before each test
   - test_teardown: Called after each test

Take a look in the test folder to see an example of how the library is used.
(fas_test is used to test itself).

To actually run your tests just invoke fastest.rb from a command line. It will
automatically recursively discover all of your test classes within the working
directory and run there tests.
